            <h2>Exploration</h2>
            <p>
                From deep desolate caves to cities in the clouds there are a lot of places to explore. There are items to collect, 
                people to meet, and monsters to fight everywhere you go, and you will likely explore most of the world across you journy.
                The whole map may not be explorable at first, possibly even for a few chapters, however as you progress you will gain 
                abilities which will allow you to handle harsher enviorments, break through obstacles, and make jumps that would have been
                impossible before.

            <h2>Combat</h2>
            <p>
                Although most of the enemies you fight wont be to poweful, you do have to remember you only have <a href="Soul.html">half a soul</a>,
                and even the simplest of enemies are prepared for a fight, so if you are not carful even a butterfly can take you out. 
                Taking on enemies and bosses requires carful planing and practice, you will find that your limited number of abilities
                will make navigating an arena, dealing with complex attack patters, and dishing out damage a very difficult task, and you will 
                likely need to make heafty comprimises just to have a chance at victory.

            <h2>Quests</h2>
            <p>
                As you interact with people and the world around you, you will be given many tasks to complete which don't always follow
                the main story. In other games you may consider these side quests, however here every quest matters. Each one will have a 
                uniqe reward at the end that you can only get from that quest, and they all connect back to the main story. Completing these 
                quests will give you items and abilities which will make you much stronger, and will introduce you to charachters which will
                play an important roll in your story.

            <h2>Chapters</h2>
            <p>
                Your story is split into 10 chapters, each explanding on the last with a new map filled with things to do. With each new chapter
                you will gain new abilities and time will progress, meaning that there will be more to do on the maps from previous chapters.
                Each chapter takes place around one of the <a href="World.html">10 Great Cities</a>, and will focus on one of the monsters
                created by <a href="Story.html">the Soul Experiments</a> as you proggress towards a fight with them. Your decitions you make in 
                each chapter will be permanat, and all of them will affect how your story ends.
