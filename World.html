            <h2>Creatures and Races</h2>
            <p>
                Within a world made entierly of magic, everything has addapted to use that magic to there surviavl. There are the fantasy
                basics, such as dragons and pheonixes, an races like half dragons, angels, and fishfolk, however the list goes much farther
                beyond that. There are insects called Blix, small as an ant, made of entierly shadow and light, with the ability to merge 
                together into a giant. There are humanoids known as Regants, their entiere body is made up of stem cells, giving them a 
                strange frail body, however they can regenerate entire limbs in minutes, and addapt to even the most lethal venoms in seconds.
                In this world seeing a cyborg is as baffeling as seeing walking rocks, which is to say not at all.
