            <h2>The Soul</h2>
            <p>
                The soul is a msytical construct which connects everyone and everything together. Every living thing has a soul,
                and even inanimate objects can connect to a soul or have their own. Every soul is uniqe, and it is a source of life,
                power, and connection, however as the name of the game suggests, you only have half a soul.
