            <h2>Soul Parts</h2>
            <p>
                The soul consists of 9 different parts which link the body to the world around it. The parts are Body, Mind, Spirit,
                Arcana, Bond, Origin, Race, Gift, and Life. Each soul is uniqe in many ways, the most obvious one however it the uniqe 
                abilities and traits each persons soul parts are linked to. A chart going more indepth into each soul part is on the right.
            </p>
        </div>

            <h2>Half a Soul?</h2>
            <p>
                Half a soul is an odd concept, especialy in a world where the soul is fundamental to existing. Half a soul in your case
                simply means you get half the soul parts, however 4.5 soul parts is not an even number so you end up with 4. This means
                you end up with less than half the abilities, strength, and energy as even an average person, putting you at a significant
                disadvantage, however you do have an ability which allows you to make up for it.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div id="left">
            <h2>Soul Swaping</h2>
            <p>
                You have a very rare power known as a collector ability, which normaly allows for the stealing of soul connections, however
                in your case it allows you to learn and make conections that you normaly would not have access to. And although you are still
                limited to a max of 4 different links, you can chose what 4 those are, allowing you to chose your abilities to better counter
                any opponent, putting a bit more balance into your fights.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div id="right">
            <h2>Synergies</h2>
            <p>
                It is very easy for traits to merge together, either enhancing eachother or granting a whole new ability. Depending on what 
                soul parts you have active, you will have access to synergies which will further ballance out the scales. There are 2 types of 
                synergies, general synergies based on broad clasifications of a soul part such as being geared towards offence or having a weapon, 
                and uniqe synergies which are based on very specific links such as 4 different abilities which all have to do with the weather.
                Synergies dont diectly provide buffs, rather depending on what parts you have active in the synergy, and what non soul part links 
                you have made, such as with people, enviorments, or relics, you will be able to chose different boosts to optimise your biuld.
