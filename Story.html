            <h2>The Tyrant of the Universe</h2>
            <p>
                Universe 1 is under the rule of a king which has gone mad in a quest for power. Using the propeganda of a great threat
                which is coming back in the near future, he justifies his place on the throne, and conducts experiments on the world which 
                have created deadly monsters which are terrorising the world around them, turned great cities and wonders of nature into 
                trrifying ruins which are no longer safe to explore, and violate laws which were put in place for the soul pourpous of
                preventing the wars and famine which currently plauge the world. Even after 100 years of his chaotic rule no one has 
                stepped up to stop him, not the strongest of heros who had slayed worse tyrants before, not the angels who are tasked with
                enforcing universal law, and not even the people whos lives have been ruined by his unyielding search for more power.

            <h2>The Soul Experiments</h2>
            <p>
                Of the kings experiments, 9 stand out as the most dangerous and cruel. They were experiments which attempted to push 
                each part of the soul far beyond its limits, and control arcane energy which would otherwise be to powerful to 
                safely conduct. These 9 experiments live as monsters controled by the arcana which they were never made to conduct, 
                and each one is raining terror on the other 9 Great Cities where the king does not reside.

            <h2>The Worlds Smartest Man</h2>
            <p>
                Before the king went into his crazed search for power, he had a friend smarter than any other. He was an engineer who 
                created inventions which baffled science and logic, and advanced those fields by miles at a time. He created his own 
                set of laws to explain how arcana works, and used them to turn light into a source of energy efficient enough to keep a 
                city made with the most advanced technology powered permently. However a fight with the king over his most recent project, 
                he dissapeared someplace of the planet, and has not been seen since.

            <h2>Project Half-Soul</h2>
            <p>
                The last known project of the smartest man, a mechanical body designed to perfectely integrate with both the wearars body 
                and soul, allowing for even fatal injuries to be repaired to a degree that only perfect healing magic could achive. However 
                just as the technology was reaching its final stage, the king discovered that it was also being used in the creation of an
                unknown superweapon. With this discovery the king became obsesed, he wanted the weapon for himself, however the smartest man 
                would not let him have it, and destroyed all indicators that it had ever existed. In retaliation the king destroyed his lab, 
                leaving everything in ruin besides a single room and its empty pedastle.
